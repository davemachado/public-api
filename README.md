# Public API for Public APIs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davemachado/public-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davemachado/public-api)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/davemachado/public-api)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/davemachado/public-api)

So, the [public-apis](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) project is all about collecting public API services from all corners of the internet, yet does not offer its own API... no longer!

This service supports [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) and requires no authentication to use. All responses are sent over HTTPS as well.

Please note that this service is still in beta, so some aspects are subject to change (base URL, documentation, etc).

If you would like to leave feedback or request a feature, please [open an issue](https://github.com/davemachado/public-api/issues). If you would like to contribute, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/davemachado/public-api/pulls).
